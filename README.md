# Cricket T20 World Cup Power BI Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing the performances of cricket players in the T20 World Cup, focusing on selecting the best 11 players based on various statistical criteria. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and consists of multiple CSV files. Data manipulation and cleaning were performed using Python's Pandas library, while data transformations and modeling were handled in Power BI. The final dashboard includes various filters, charts, and tables that allow users to explore different aspects of player performance.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset was collected from Kaggle. It consists of multiple CSV files that contain match-level and player-level statistics.
- **Files**: These CSV files include data on player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes.
  
## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Data was downloaded from Kaggle in CSV format.
   - The dataset includes statistics for T20 World Cup matches, players, teams, and outcomes.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation (Using Pandas)**
   - Data was loaded into Jupyter Notebooks, and initial exploration was performed using Pandas.
   - Missing values were handled by filling or removing where appropriate.
   - Columns were renamed, and data types were adjusted to ensure consistency across all datasets.
   - Irrelevant columns were dropped, and new features were created where necessary (e.g., calculating strike rates, economy rates, etc.).

### 3. **Data Structuring (Using Excel)**
   - Cleaned CSV files were exported to Excel for further manipulation.
   - In Excel, each sheet represented one table, and the necessary columns were standardized across all sheets to facilitate data linking.
   - A special step was taken to name a common column in each sheet, which would be used later for establishing relationships between tables in Power BI.

### 4. **Power BI Dashboard Development**
   - The cleaned Excel sheets were imported into Power BI for building the dashboard.
   - In Power Query Editor, additional transformations were made:
     - Duplicates were removed.
     - New calculated columns were created, including aggregated statistics (runs, wickets, strike rates, etc.).
     - Relationships between the tables were created using the common column that was named consistently across all sheets.
   
### 5. **Dashboard Design**
   - Various visualizations were created, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent player and team performances.
   - Filters were added to allow users to explore data by match, team, player, and tournament stage.
   - Key metrics, such as top run-scorers, best bowlers, and overall player performance, were highlighted to assist in selecting the best 11 players.
   
### 6. **Selection of Best 11 Players**
   - The analysis focused on identifying the best 11 players based on multiple performance metrics:
     - Batting: Runs scored, strike rate, average.
     - Bowling: Wickets taken, economy rate, bowling average.
     - Fielding: Catches, run-outs, stumpings.
   - A combination of advanced filters and calculated columns was used to narrow down the players based on their overall contribution to the team's success.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
   - **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter the data based on matches, players, teams, and time periods.
   - **Player Comparisons**: Compare player performance across various metrics to select the top 11 players.
   - **Visual Representation**: Graphs and charts provide a clear visual representation of player statistics, making it easier to analyze data.
   - **Power Query Editor**: Further data transformations and column linking were performed to ensure that the data model was clean and efficient.

## Tools and Technologies Used
   - **Python (Pandas)**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
   - **Excel**: For data structuring and ensuring consistency across datasets.
   - **Power BI**: For dashboard development, including Power Query transformations and visualization.
   - **Kaggle**: Data source.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to analyze cricket statistics and derive insights from large datasets using Power BI. The final dashboard allows users to interactively explore player and team performances, making it easier to identify the best 11 players from the T20 World Cup. The combination of Python, Excel, and Power BI ensured that the data was thoroughly cleaned and modeled for optimal analysis.
